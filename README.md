# CapstoneProject for DF
# Capstone Project for Digital Futures : Key factors that determine the intensity of Lung Cancer
## Objective
The goal of the project was to identify the critical factors that significantly impacted how serious the patient's lung cancer was.

Develop a model that can predict the crucial factors that will have the biggest effects on lung cancer progression.

The model can then be applied to help those whose genes or way of life put them at risk for developing lung cancer or lessen the intensity of the cancer as well as provide information that can help prevent lung cancer from ever occurring in the first place.
## Task
•	A dataset on Kaggle which was a study conducted in China on the intensity of lung cancer in patients with different categorical variables which were ranked from 1-9 (1     meaning very low and 9 being very high).

•	Performing EDA and cleaning the data to make sure it was ready for modelling.

•	Modelling the data to predict if there was a correlation between the intensity of lung cancer and the key factors.

•	Limitations of the project and a summary.

## Presenting the Capstone

The project was due on the 31st of March 2023 and was presented by myself to my instructor and other cohorts members at DF
